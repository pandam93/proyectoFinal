                To JSON Customizing The Pagination View Using Bootstrap
                Paginator Instance Methods Introduction In other frameworks,
                pagination can be very painful. We hope Laravel's approach to
                pagination will be a breath of fresh air. Laravel's paginator is
                integrated with the query builder and Eloquent ORM and provides
                convenient, easy-to-use pagination of database records with zero
                configuration. By default, the HTML generated by the paginator
                is compatible with the Tailwind CSS framework; however,
                Bootstrap pagination support is also available. Basic Usage
                Paginating Query Builder Results There are several ways to
                paginate items. The simplest is by using the paginate method on
                the query builder or an Eloquent query. The paginate method
                automatically takes care of setting the query's "limit" and
                "offset" based on the current page being viewed by the user. By
                default, the current page is detected by the value of the page
                query string argument on the HTTP request. This value is
                automatically detected by Laravel, and is also automatically
                inserted into links generated by the paginator. In this example,
                the only argument passed to the paginate method is the number of
                items you would like displayed "per page". In this case, let's
                specify that we would like to display 15 items per page:

                <?php
            
            namespace App\Http\Controllers;
            
            use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
            use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
            
            class UserController extends Controller
            {
                /**
                 * Show all of the users for the application.
                 *
                 * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
                 */
                public function index()
                {
                    return view('user.index', [
                        'users' =>
                DB::table('users')->paginate(15) ]); } } "Simple Pagination" The
                paginate method counts the total number of records matched by
                the query before retrieving the records from the database. This
                is done so that the paginator knows how many pages of records
                there are in total. However, if you do not plan to show the
                total number of pages in your application's UI then the record
                count query is unnecessary. Therefore, if you only need to
                display simple "Next" and "Previous" links in your application's
                UI, you may use the simplePaginate method to perform a single,
                efficient query: $users =
                DB::table('users')->simplePaginate(15); Paginating Eloquent
